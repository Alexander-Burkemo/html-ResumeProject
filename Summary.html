    <h1>My Summary</h1>
    <hr />
    <p>
        I graduated from the University of Utah December 2023. Sense then I've exerpeiced some jobs that my degree has
        to offer and have chosen to pivot into Computer Science. A lot of the things I find interesting involve
        technology and i've always wanted to have a better understand to how they work. I was recommened the Udemy
        bootcamp by a friend and this resume is one of there projects. So far this course has been a lot of fun and I'm
        excited to take other Udemy boot camps given there price and how much I'm leaning.
    </p>

        I have signed up for Utah Valley Unviersity and will be starting this Fall semester. I'm really looking forward
        to learning the nitty gritty in the CS major program while I learn more practical skills through bootcamps. I
        want to follow many passions instead of what I think will be safe. I'm going to look into game development,
        building websites, I'd like to learn about AI and VR theres a lot in this feild that gets me excited to learn
        and If im passionate I belive a career will follow.
